# 🐔 Poultry Disease Classification using Transfer Learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify poultry diseases using transfer learning. The model classifies images of poultry into four categories: **Healthy**, **Salmonella**, **New Castle Disease**, and **Coccidiosis**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Model**: Transfer Learning with VGG16/ResNet50
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **UI**: Flask Web Application (Optional)
- **Deployment**: Local or Cloud (Render/Heroku/Streamlit)
- **Goal**: Help farmers and poultry experts detect diseases early using image classification.
