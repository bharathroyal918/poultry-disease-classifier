ðŸ”¬ A Deep Learning-Powered Web App to Detect Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Transfer Learning-based image classification system that detects four poultry conditions from chicken images:

Salmonella

New Castle Disease

Coccidiosis

Healthy

It leverages deep learning (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) and is integrated into a Flask-based web application. The goal is to empower farmers, researchers, and veterinary students with fast, accurate, and user-friendly poultry disease diagnosis.
